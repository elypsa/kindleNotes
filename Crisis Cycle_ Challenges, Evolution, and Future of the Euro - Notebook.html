</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - Page 19 · Location 512
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    Most policy analysis looks at actions and their short-term effects: Should the ECB raise or lower interest rates or buy bonds? But monetary, fiscal, and financial policies revolve around what people expect to happen, how they expect governments to behave in the future, and how governments’ current actions shape those expectations.
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - 2.1. Monetary-Fiscal Interaction > Page 21 · Location 554
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    Extra money does not invariably cause inflation. If the money (reserves) pays the same interest as the asset (risk-free short-term government bonds of a single state such as the United States), then there really is no effect at all. Banks are just as willing to hold one as the other, the central bank makes no profits, and there are no implied transfers from one state to another.
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - 2.1. Monetary-Fiscal Interaction > Page 22 · Location 561

<div class="noteText">
    Similarly, if the central bank stops paying full interest on reserves, people will want to get rid of the reserves and inflation will break out.

</div>
<div class="noteText">
    Contrary to the popular proverb, a currency union without fiscal union union is perfectly possible, so long as it is clearly understood that member states default if they cannot repay their debts, just as private firms and individuals do. If sovereigns cannot be allowed to default, it’s a fiscal union.

    The risk became palpable in the sovereign debt crisis, which we describe in detail below. If a country leaves the euro, that country may well default on its Target2 debt, as well as its sovereign debts. It is not clear how the ECB would react, as there is no rule book for such defaults. But like sovereign default, it would blow a hole in the ECB’s balance sheet, which eventually is covered by the remaining member states.

<div class="noteText">
    official Europe paid little or no attention to brewing sovereign risk. With the wake-up call that systemic banking crises can happen in the contemporary era, Europe’s financial regulators still did nothing to address the risky sovereign debt on bank balance sheets. Indeed, the ECB’s large-scale loans to banks ended up unintentionally worsening this risk, encouraging larger sovereign debt on bank balance sheets and financing balance of payments.

    “We are not here to close spreads” is likely the second most memorable and impactful statement by an ECB president (after “whatever it takes”). This statement led to the single largest daily yield increase in Italian sovereign debt in history. The jump in yields revealed suddenly just how much continuing expectation of ECB intervention, an implicit “ECB put,” was keeping Italian and other spreads low in the first place.

    The ECB did not budge the deposit rate even up to zero until July 2022, when inflation was over 8%, a full year after inflation broke out. This delay is unusual. Even in the inflationary 1970s, most central banks did not wait so long to respond to higher inflation with higher interest rates.

    But overall the ECB maintained its accommodative monetary stance for 2021 and the first half of 2022 while inflation kept rising. This stance included negative interest rates, moderated but continued net purchases under the Asset Purchase Program (APP), an extension of the reinvestment horizon for the PEPP until the end of 2024, announced in December 2021, and generous lending or “liquidity provision” to banks in Targeted Long Term Refinancing Operations (TLTRO).

    The ECB mentioned here that “fiscal measures, including at the European Union level, would also help to shield the economy.” In assessing fiscal policy, the ECB was still worried about lack of demand, not excess stimulus, though the pandemic borrowing and its monetization were just in the rearview mirror, the V-shaped recovery was proving the Covid recession to be a supply rather than a demand shock, and inflation was surging.

</div>
<div class="noteText">
    Does inflation control by the central bank require diagnosis of the shock and different responses for different shocks? One’s inclination is to say “of course it does.” For example, the central bank should diagnose and respond differently to “supply” versus “demand” shocks, “real” versus “financial” shocks, and so forth. But given that the nature of the shocks is still hotly debated three years later, requiring central banks to diagnose and respond differently to shocks in real time is obviously a challenging task.

<div class="noteText">
    Simple rules like the Taylor rule (without shocks or time-varying natural rates) prescribe the same response to inflation, no matter the shock. Though such rules are less than perfect-information optimal, such an approach may be more realistic in real time.

<div class="noteText">
    More importantly, if it is hard for the decisions of monetary policy to condition, in real time, on the source of shocks, the institutions of monetary policy should be well adapted to multiple shocks. If 2021–2023 inflation was driven by a big fiscal shock or a big supply shock, we need monetary policy rules, habits, and institutions that will contain inflation next time.

    But supply shocks alone do not tell the complete story of inflation. Supply shocks per se only cause changes in relative prices. If the economy can produce fewer cars or TVs, then the price of cars or TVs must rise relative to restaurant meals and wages. But the latter could fall rather than the former rise. How does a relative price shock raise all prices and wages?

    This is too rigorous. In practice, wage rigidities, monetary policy responses, and "second-round effects" (where higher prices in key items translate to broader price and wage rises) can convert a relative price shock into generalized inflation.

    Moreover, a supply shock alone gives a transitory rise in a price level, not a transitory rise in the inflation rate. If car factories close, the price of cars rises. But when the factories open again, the price of cars falls back to where it was. A period of car deflation follows the car inflation. We have seen a rise in inflation that seems finally to be easing, but no commensurate deflation that brings the price level back to where it was.

    In the end, for prices to rise, demand must be there as well. People must still have the money and desire to buy the goods under supply shock. A supply shock translates to general inflation, and a permanent rise in all prices, only when and because the shock is accommodated by monetary and fiscal policies.

<div class="noteText">
    We focus on monetary policy first. Facing a relative price shock, such as an energy supply disruption, the central bank can choose whether to have higher energy prices or lower prices of everything else, and no inflation. Since central banks believe price and wage cuts to be more damaging than rises, they choose a higher overall price level. The central bank lets other prices rise too, so higher energy costs feed through to higher costs of goods that use energy. This accommodation is the standard analysis of the 1970s energy price shocks, for example. By leaving interest rates at or close to zero in the face of inflation approaching 10%, then, the ECB and other central banks accommodated the supply shocks, let them spread throughout the economy, and provided the necessary demand.

    Thus, if this is the story, monetary policy in the union must get over the fear of local declines in some prices and wages. In part, this simply requires a return to the original philosophy, namely that the EMU worries about the union-wide price level, not making sure that no individual country, industry, or sector sees price or wage declines.

    Central banks often use “demand” almost as a synonym for “output,” and regard “supply” as at best a very slow-moving object, along with “potential” output and the natural interest rate “r star.” Well, if this inflation came from a fast-moving supply shock that central bank forecasts, models, and analysis completely missed,

    Suggestively, the price level started rising soon after the debt expansion started and it also rose about 20% from end-2020 to end-2024. This increase implies that the price level overshot by almost 12% the price level that would have resulted if the ECB had met its 2% target in these years. Approximately 12% of the outstanding longer-term public debt has been inflated away, equivalent to default with a 12% haircut.

    Generally, 1% or 3% interest rates do not represent significant tightening when inflation is 7% or even 10%! Conventional macroeconomic doctrine says that inflation, once started, will spiral away until interest rates rise substantially above inflation, and only by causing a recession, reducing inflation via the Phillips curve. The early 1980s stand as the classic case, but 2022–2023 refutes that doctrine.

    As the ECB started to raise interest rates, it announced a new bond-buying program, the Transmission Protection Instrument (TPI), on July 21, 2022. This is a highly significant new program, greatly liberalizing the ECB’s rules, traditions and expectations surrounding sovereign debt purchases. It is a fitting capstone to our story of eroding barriers between monetary and fiscal policy.

    The previous rules did not fail because they were too simple, and needed a country-specific bilaterally-negotiated stochastic debt simulation. The previous rules failed “because it is France,” as Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker put it. The same could have been said of Germany or Italy. The EU was unable or unwilling to force countries to abide by the simple and transparent rules they had agreed to and then found inconvenient, even in the mild early 2000s. New, more complex, and less transparent rules do nothing to address this central problem, no matter how pretty they are on the planning table. Indeed, they arguably make the problem worse, for several reasons.

    The new rules rely explicitly on bilateral negotiations with the Commission. That raises the risk of political pressure, especially from larger member states capable of threatening vetoes or otherwise causing trouble for the Commission on crucial decisions. The rules ignore the central problems of time-consistency and precomitment. Reform commitments are supposed to be implemented over multiple-year horizons, significantly beyond the horizon of most elected officials. What are the incentives of a government to stick to promises for reforms and consolidation plans made several years ago, if they ex post appear politically too costly? How can a government’s promise to implement an important but politically difficult labor market, tax, or pension reform be enforced if a new government with different priorities is elected? Will the Commission then go against the outcome of a democratic election and insist that a policy be implemented, even when the majority of voters just rejected it?

    The fogginess of “sustainability” is understandable. It does not represent nefarious behavior, it just represents pretending to do the impossible. Economists can’t agree whether any country’s debt, from Japan to Argentina, is sustainable. Some economists think all government debt is sustainable, as the long-term interest rate is less than the GDP growth rate. Every country is solvent with enough austerity, and every country is insolvent with enough largesse. It is harder still to distinguish market dysfunction, illiquidity, or multiple equilibria from insolvency in real time.

    Less significant institutions remain under national supervision, though in collaboration with the ECB. Cross-border financial integration faces significant regulatory restrictions. Cross-border capital waivers are prohibited, and no liquidity waivers have been granted due to resistance from the national competent authorities, which can use powers outside the prudential domain to block such moves. Similarly, the conversion of international subsidiaries into branches is rare in retail banking, due in part to local deposit insurance schemes and tax considerations, though some international wholesale banks have used this structure. This fragmentation limits the potential economies of scale of cross-border mergers. International banks remain subject to multiple national regulators and supervisors, as well as the SSM. This can still lead to conflicts between the supervisors of the headquarters country (home) and those of the bank’s subsidiaries (host). Home and host supervisors sometimes issue conflicting orders, require duplicate capital and liquidity, and make cross-border mergers inefficient. Host countries fear that home-country supervisors will prefer saving the parent bank to the detriment of foreign subsidiaries. Host countries impede inside-the-bank resource transfers in order to protect local depositors and boost local lending. Both home and host authorities may influence credit allocation of the banks toward their country.
